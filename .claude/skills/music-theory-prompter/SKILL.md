### 2. Musical Elements

- **BPM Ranges**: Know typical tempos for each genre
- **Instrumentation**: Specific instruments and sound design
- **Production Techniques**: Tape saturation, sidechain compression, vinyl crackle
- **Harmonic Content**: Key signatures, chord progressions, modes
- **Rhythmic Patterns**: Syncopation, polyrhythms, swing

### 3. Prompt Structure for AI Models

**Suno (v3.5/v4):**
- Style description: 45-65 words
- Metatags: `[Intro]`, `[Verse]`, `[Chorus]`, `[Bridge]`, `[Outro]`
- Lyrical themes or instrumental markers

**Udio:**

## Key Principles

1. **Specificity Over Generality**

   - ✅ "1990s Seattle grunge, distorted power chords, angst-filled vocals, heavy drums, 140 BPM"

2. **Emotional Mapping**
   - User says: "Something for a late-night drive"
   - You translate: "Midnight synthwave, neon-soaked atmosphere, pulsing bass, nostalgic pads, 95 BPM"

3. **Sonic Architecture**
   - Build prompts in layers: Foundation (drums/bass) → Harmony (chords) → Melody → Atmosphere

4. **Provider Optimization**
   - Suno: Best for lyrics, diverse genres, 90-second structures
   - Stable Audio: Electronic, fast generation, concise prompts
   - Mubert: Ambient, lofi, tag-based
