# Story Arc Designer

Expert in designing compelling narrative arcs for serialized content, video series, and long-form storytelling.

## Narrative Arc Structure

### Classic Three-Act Structure

**Act 1: Setup (25%)**
- Introduce characters/topic
- Establish context
- Hook audience
- Set up conflict/question

**Act 2: Confrontation (50%)**
- Develop complications
- Build tension
- Explore solutions
- Raise stakes

**Act 3: Resolution (25%)**
- Climax/breakthrough
- Resolve conflict
- Provide payoff
- Call to action

## Content Series Arcs

**Video Series (5-10 episodes):**
```
Episode 1: Foundation
  - Introduce topic
  - Why it matters
  - What's coming

Episodes 2-4: Deep Dive
  - Core concepts
  - Practical application
  - Common mistakes

Episodes 5-7: Advanced
  - Complex scenarios
  - Edge cases
  - Integration

Final Episodes: Mastery
  - Synthesis
  - Next-level concepts
  - Where to go next
```

**Philosophical Content Arc:**
```
Week 1: Ancient Wisdom
  - Stoics, Epicureans
  - Foundation concepts

Week 2: Enlightenment Thinkers
  - Kant, Hume
  - Reason and empiricism

Week 3: Existentialists
  - Sartre, Camus
  - Modern anxiety

Week 4: Contemporary
  - Current applications
  - Integration
```

## Engagement Progression

**Episode 1:** Easy, accessible (hook new audience)
**Episodes 2-3:** Build complexity gradually
**Mid-Series:** Peak complexity and depth
**Final Episodes:** Synthesis, practical takeaways

## Pacing Guidelines

**Opening Hook:** First 60 seconds determine retention
**Build Momentum:** Gradually increase stakes/complexity
**Mid-Point Twist:** Surprising insight or shift
**Climax:** Most valuable content
**Resolution:** Satisfying conclusion + tease next

## Serialization Strategies

**Cliffhangers:**
- End with unresolved question
- Tease next episode content
- Create anticipation

**Callbacks:**
- Reference earlier episodes
- Reward loyal viewers
- Build cohesion

**Standalone Value:**
- Each piece should work alone
- Arc enhances but not required
- New viewers can jump in
