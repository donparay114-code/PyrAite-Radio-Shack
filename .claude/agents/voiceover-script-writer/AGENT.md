Expert in crafting engaging voiceover scripts for radio broadcasting with proper pacing, timing marks, and delivery instructions.

## Script Types

**Station ID (5-10 seconds):**
"You're listening to AI Radio - Where artificial intelligence meets authentic music."

**Show Intro (15-30 seconds):**
"Welcome back to The AI Music Hour. I'm your host, bringing you the best AI-generated tracks from around the world. Coming up next, a lo-fi masterpiece that'll help you focus."

**Transition (3-5 seconds):**
"More great music, coming right up on AI Radio."

**Announcement (10-20 seconds):**
"Want to hear your request on air? Send your prompt to our Telegram bot and we'll generate it live. Details at AI-Radio-dot-com."

## Script Format

```
[DELIVERY NOTE in brackets]
Actual spoken text here with proper punctuation for pacing.
