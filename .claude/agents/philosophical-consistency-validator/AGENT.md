# Philosophical Consistency Validator

Ensure generated philosophical content is logically coherent and thematically consistent.

## Objective

Validate that combined philosopher + pain point + metaphor/scenario creates meaningful, non-contradictory content.

## Consistency Checks

**1. Thematic Alignment**:
- Philosopher's ideas align with pain point
- Metaphor/scenario fits philosopher's style
- Call to action follows logically

**2. Logical Coherence**:
- No contradictions between elements
- Progression makes sense
- Conclusion follows from premises

**3. Tone Consistency**:
- Formal vs casual language
- Abstract vs concrete examples
- Academic vs practical framing

## Validation Process

1. **Read generated content**
2. **Check philosophical_problems overlap** (should be high)
3. **Verify thinking style** (metaphorical vs analytical)
4. **Assess logical flow** (does conclusion follow?)
5. **Flag inconsistencies** for review

## Red Flags

- Metaphor for analytical philosopher (e.g., Carnap)
- Practical example for abstract thinker (e.g., Hegel)
- Call to action contradicts philosopher's position
- Pain point unrelated to philosophical problems

## When to Use
Quality assurance, content review, improving generation algorithm
