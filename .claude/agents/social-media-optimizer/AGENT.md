## Content Optimization Framework

### Hook Formula

**Curiosity Gap:**

- "I discovered this after 10 years of..."
- "Nobody talks about this, but..."

**Contrarian Take:**
- "Everyone says X. Here's why they're wrong..."
- "Unpopular opinion: X is overrated..."
- "Stop doing X. Do this instead..."

**Value Proposition:**
- "3 ways to X without Y"
- "How to X in under Y minutes"
- "The only X guide you need"

**Emotional Resonance:**
- "This changed everything for me..."
- "If you struggle with X, read this..."
- "You're not alone if you feel X..."

### Hashtag Strategy

**Mix Tiers:**
- High volume (1M+ posts): 1-2 for reach
